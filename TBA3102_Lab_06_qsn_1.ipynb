An amazing product given the price.  buy parent connect facebok messenger phone video call easy use learn though highly recommend keyboard case bring read news site new tablet format small useful amazing product give price             2\n",

I started removing them, even to the point of restoring to factory settings several times. After trying for about a week, it simply would not stay connected to the internet. It did stay connected to our wifi. I contacted Best Buy, but since it had been over 2 weeks, their policy is they can't help, unless you've purchased the extended warranty from them. They said that's Amazon's policy. I contacted Amazon, and after a fairly brief support chat, a new Kindle was on the way to its new home. I've been pleased with it since its arrival. It does most of what I need (email, facebook, minimal web use), saving \"wear &amp; tear\" on my laptop.</td>\n",

It was plugged in each evening and on the 4th day, it was at 7% after being plugged in all night. This was our second Amazon Fire Tablet, the first one stopped charging in month 13, right after the manufacturer's warranty expired. Decided to get another one because it was a great deal, but sadly I've learned you don't even get what you pay for with this tablet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     4 day device would charge plug evening th day 7 plug night second amazon fire tablet first one stop charge month 13 right manufacturer warranty expire decide get another one great deal sadly learn even get pay tablet            10\n",

       "14116  So far the only complaint I have is not with the product but with the policy regarding the product. I had one for just about 2 weeks when I noticed a definite issue staying connected. My wife, who has had her Kindle Fire for months, said her started acting up if she had too many apps on it. I started removing them, even to the point of restoring to factory settings several times. After trying for about a week, it simply would not stay connected to the internet. It did stay connected to our wifi. I contacted Best Buy, but since it had been over 2 weeks, their policy is they can't help, unless you've purchased the extended warranty from them. They said that's Amazon's policy. I contacted Amazon, and after a fairly brief support chat, a new Kindle was on the way to its new home. I've been pleased with it since its arrival. It does most of what I need (email, facebook, minimal web use), saving \"wear & tear\" on my laptop.  far complaint product policy regard product one 2 week notice definite issue stay connect wife kindle fire month say start act many start remove even point restore factory setting several time try week simply would stay connect internet stay connect wife contract good buy since 2 week policy help unless purchase extend warranty say amazon policy contract amazon fairly brief support chat new kindle way new home please since arrival need email facebok minimal web use save wear tear lawton            10"

       "      <td>We purchased this tablet for my daughter for Christmas. She is in kindergarten, and her school allows them to take a device in to use in class. For $39 I couldn't beat that. Especially since i'm not going to send a 5 year old to school with an iPad!This tablet uses FireOS, which is Amazon's customized version of Android. Typically when I look at an android tablet, major deviations from vanilla Android will make me deduct ratings. The parental controls override any rating deduction in my mind. This tablet has the best parental controls I have ever seen! In addition, the alterations to the home screen make navigation pretty easy for my daughter. All in all this is a win win!The thing that has really impressed me has been the speed and responsiveness. Don't get me wrong, this is not a premium or flagship tablet by any means. With that being said, I have used Android tablets in this price range, and they are garbage! My wife has an insignia tablet that cost $70. It has a higher res screen and a few more features, but it nowhere near as responsive. When it dies it will probably be replaced by an Amazon Fire tablet!Keep in mind, Amazon is trying to hook you into their ecosystem. There are separate home screens for various types of content that Amazon delivers. Your books on one screen, or you can swipe to music on another, etc. From what I see there is no way to have more than one screen of apps. The nice thing about the Amazon ecosystem is that it is cross platform. They maintain apps for Android, iOS, Roku, Windows, MacOS, and so on. Also, their app store is not as extensive as the Google Play Store, so I may end up doing some side loading. That isn't hard, and instructional guides are available online for you.So in conclusion, this is a nice entry level tablet. I would bump up to the Fire HD8 for the extra features if buying for myself. However if buying for younger children or if you're really tight on cash you can't beat it! My twin boys are about to turn 3, and these might be on their list for birthday time!</td>\n",

       "12772  We purchased this tablet for my daughter for Christmas. She is in kindergarten, and her school allows them to take a device in to use in class. For $39 I couldn't beat that. Especially since i'm not going to send a 5 year old to school with an iPad!This tablet uses FireOS, which is Amazon's customized version of Android. Typically when I look at an android tablet, major deviations from vanilla Android will make me deduct ratings. The parental controls override any rating deduction in my mind. This tablet has the best parental controls I have ever seen! In addition, the alterations to the home screen make navigation pretty easy for my daughter. All in all this is a win win!The thing that has really impressed me has been the speed and responsiveness. Don't get me wrong, this is not a premium or flagship tablet by any means. With that being said, I have used Android tablets in this price range, and they are garbage! My wife has an insignia tablet that cost $70. It has a higher res screen and a few more features, but it nowhere near as responsive. When it dies it will probably be replaced by an Amazon Fire tablet!Keep in mind, Amazon is trying to hook you into their ecosystem. There are separate home screens for various types of content that Amazon delivers. Your books on one screen, or you can swipe to music on another, etc. From what I see there is no way to have more than one screen of apps. The nice thing about the Amazon ecosystem is that it is cross platform. They maintain apps for Android, iOS, Roku, Windows, MacOS, and so on. Also, their app store is not as extensive as the Google Play Store, so I may end up doing some side loading. That isn't hard, and instructional guides are available online for you.So in conclusion, this is a nice entry level tablet. I would bump up to the Fire HD8 for the extra features if buying for myself. However if buying for younger children or if you're really tight on cash you can't beat it! My twin boys are about to turn 3, and these might be on their list for birthday time!  purchase tablet daughter christmas kindergarten school allow take device use class 39 could beat especially since go send 5 year old school ipadthis tablet use fire amazon customize version andro typically look andro tablet major deviation vanilla andro make deduce rating parental control overrule rating deduction mind tablet good parental control ever see addition alteration home screen make navigation pretty easy daughter win thing really impressed speed responsiveness get wrong premium flagship tablet mean say use andro tablet price range garage wife insignia tablet cost 70 high yes screen feature nowhere near responsive die probably replace amazon fire tabletop mind amazon try hook ecosystem separate home screen various type content amazon deliver book one screen wipe music another etc see way one screen nice thing amazon ecosystem cross platform maintain andro rou window face also store extensive goose play store may end side load hard instruction guide available online conclusion nice entry level tablet would bump fire extra feature buy however buy young child really tight cash beat twin boy turn 3 might list birthday time            11\n",

Our first unit had an issue after updating the OS, but Amazon is amazing and exchanged the device, no questions asked. I would have gone through Best Buy, but our local one didn't have the pink one in stock anymore. I would have preferred that it didn't come with a camera or microphone for privacy reasons (my older kids 3 year old Kindle Fire HDs don't have a camera or microphone).

       "10040  Purchased for my 3 year old, love that it comes with Kindle Freetime (which is almost $80 on it's own). It's perfect for curious fingers prone to swiping and clicking wherever, since the parental controls lock it down to keep them from being able to exit their own profile. Our first unit had an issue after updating the OS, but Amazon is amazing and exchanged the device, no questions asked. I would have gone through Best Buy, but our local one didn't have the pink one in stock anymore. I would have preferred that it didn't come with a camera or microphone for privacy reasons (my older kids 3 year old Kindle Fire HDs don't have a camera or microphone). All-in-all, it is a great device for little ones, but definitely enough power and features to grow with them.  purchase 3 year old love come kindle retire almost 80 perfect curious finger prone wipe clink wherever since parental control lock keep able exit profile first unit issue date os amazon amazing exchange device question ask would go good buy local one pink one stock anymore would preferred come camera microphone privacy reason old kiss 3 year old kindle fire camera microphone final great device little one definitely enough power feature grow            12\n",
