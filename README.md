# TBA3102_Labs
Practical Labs Assignments from module TBA 3102 - Text Analytics (AY 2022/23) of National University of Singapore (NUS)

This module builds on prior data analytics knowledge that students have acquired in prerequisite modules to gradually impart the theoretical concepts and practical skills of text analytics to students. The knowledge that students gain from this module would in turn prepare them for other relevant higher-level modules and the capstone project.
